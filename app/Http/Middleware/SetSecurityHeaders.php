 * These do not replace contextual escaping or CSRF tokens but
 * they cut off whole classes of side-channel exploitation
 * (clickjacking, MIME sniffing, downgrade, referrer leak).
 *
 * CSP is intentionally not set here: the project ships rich third
 * party assets (Quill, BaconQrCode SVG, Bootstrap icons, payment
 * gateway iframes) and a hand-rolled CSP would break the UI. Add
 * a per-route CSP via a separate middleware when ready.
